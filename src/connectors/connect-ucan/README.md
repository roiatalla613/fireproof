## Connect Fireproof to IPFS

This uses web3.storage to upload CAR files (the same ones in Fireproof local storage) and then uses the IPFS gateway to retrieve them.

It also includes support for access control via UCAN delegation.

This connector is a work in progress so you should use it but also expect to contribute improvements. Thanks!
