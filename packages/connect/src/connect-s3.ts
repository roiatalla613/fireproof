  /**
   * metaDownload Function
   *
   * This function downloads metadata for a specific name and branch.
   *
   * Proposed Algorithm for Efficient Reads:
   *
   * 1. Read the Directory:
   *    - Fetch the list of keys in the directory, sorted by their timestamp in descending orderâ€”newest to oldest.
   *
   * 2. Initialize a Skip List:
   *    - Create an empty set data structure to keep track of the parent nodes that can be skipped.
   *
   * 3. Iterate through Keys:
   *    - Start from the newest key and move towards the oldest.
   *    - If the key is in the skip list, skip the read and continue.
   *    - Read the node and add its parents to the skip list.
   *
   * 4. Idempotent Application:
   *    - Apply the nodes to your DAG. Given that your application is idempotent, there's no harm in reapplying nodes,
   *      but the skip list should minimize this.
   *
   * 5. State Tracking:
   *    - Keep track of the oldest key you've successfully processed. This becomes the starting point for your next read,
   *      adjusted for the safety window.
   *
   * 6. Retry Logic:
   *    - If a key is missing, you could either skip it (since the system is designed to be eventually consistent) or
   *      implement some kind of retry logic.
   *
   * By implementing this algorithm, we aim to minimize the number of reads and work with the most current snapshot
   * of the data. It also avoids the need to delete keys, thereby averting the read-modify-write race condition.
   *
   * Writes: https://chat.openai.com/share/5dd42b0e-cbb8-4006-823b-7269df05e9eb
   *
   * @param params - The parameters for the download, including the name and branch.
   * @returns - Returns the metadata bytes as a Uint8Array or null if the fetch is unsuccessful.
